# joycon2py
A light Python script that turns the Joy Con 2's into working PC controllers.

Joy Con 2's (Switch 2) currently do not work natively on PC. This project aims to fix that.

# DISCLAIMER
This project will primarily focus on Windows (and is windows only), mostly because vgamepad is Windows exclusive. You are free to make your own MacOS/Linux version of the script however. 

# DEPENDENCIES
- python (duh)  
- bleak (`pip install bleak`)  
- vgamepad (`pip install vgamepad`) (requires installation of ViGEmBus drivers, found here: https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest)  

# How does it work?
Starting up the program, it'll look for JoyCons. If it finds one, it'll connect to it and start looking for input notifications, through which we obtain input data from the JoyCon.  
It mainly uses bleak for this BLE stuff.  
We use vgamepad for neatly packaging it into a controller.  

# How do I use it?
- SOLO:
- Open the program up  
- Put the JoyCon you wanna add into sync mode (small button on the colored bit) 
- It'll ask you what side JoyCon it is (bits tend to be shifted on different sides so do this so your data gets sent right)  
- It'll start parsing every input from the JoyCon into an SDL XBox 360 Controller through vgamepad.  
- DUAL:
- nothing here yet

# Can I edit the code?
Sure! Make any changes you want. Maybe make a pull request out of it..

# TODO
- Add Sideways mode
- Add Dual JoyCon mode (seperate script)
