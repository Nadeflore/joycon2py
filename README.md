# joycon2py

A lightweight Python script that turns the Joy-Con 2's and the Pro Controller 2 into working PC Controllers.

---

## DISCLAIMER

This project is **Windows-only**, primarily because `vgamepad` (used for virtual controller output) is exclusive to Windows.  
You're free to make your own macOS/Linux fork if you want.

Supported controllers:  
Joy-Con 2: Full support  
Pro Controller 2: Full support  
NSO GC Controller: Semi support (Joysticks confirmed to work, buttons may not be mapped/mapped correctly in code yet, requires data sent over by someone with one)  

If the program crashes, it means it couldn't connect to your joycon, often caused by:  
1. Disconnecting and connecting in a short amount of time. Fix - Wait a little before reconnecting them
2. Pairing through a button press - this never works, please use the Sync button as directed by the program

## Will there be GYRO support?

Recently, GYROACCEL data has been found. The current code WILL enable IMU and also decode/parse the data, but it won't do anything with it. Why?  
Simple answer: vgamepad doesn't support gyroaccel. Honestly, vgamepad seems very limiting. Having something else would be quite nice.. so if you have an idea, make sure to let me know.

(i feel like sending gyroaccel data through UDP/Dolphin's AIS/DSU would be kinda cool but idk how to set that up. if anyone else does, feel free to make a fork outta that)

## DEPENDENCIES

- Python (3.7+)
- [`bleak`](https://github.com/hbldh/bleak)  
  ‚Üí `pip install bleak`  
- [`vgamepad`](https://github.com/yannbouteiller/vgamepad)  
  ‚Üí `pip install vgamepad`  
  ‚Üí Requires [ViGEmBus drivers](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases/latest) installed

## How do I use it?
- Download the whole repo (green button titled code, press download zip. you can delete readme.md if you want)
- Open the main.py script (dont open the other scripts those are modules)
- Pick your amount of players
- Pick everyone's controller
- If using a singular joycon you'll be asked if its Left or Right
- If using dual joycons itll ask you to pair one joycon then the other
- If using a pro controller/gc controller it just asks you to pair it
- When its all done, you'll have SDL controllers ready for every player to use.

- If the controller disconnects, the code will (eventually) notice the disconnection, and promptly wait for you to reconnect your controller. You do this by, again, holding down your sync button.

> üí° Note: Bit layouts differ slightly between left and right Joy-Cons, so correct side pairing is important.

# Joy-Con 2 BLE Notification Research

This document outlines some findings related to Joy-Con 2 BLE input behavior. If you're developing or reverse-engineering Joy-Con 2, Pro Controller 2, or other supported Nintendo controllers over BLE, this may be useful.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Behavior Quirks

A notable quirk of these controllers is that if you attempt to connect or pair them repeatedly in a short time span, they may stop responding or fail to connect entirely for several minutes. This appears to be a controller-level cooldown behavior rather than an OS/BLE stack issue.

**If your controller stops connecting:**  
Wait a few minutes before trying again. It should recover on its own.

## üîî BLE Notification (with IMU enabled, Left Joy-Con)

Here‚Äôs an example notification received from a Joy-Con 2 via BLE, with the IMU command sent. (Pro Controller 2 and GC Controller notifications follow similar layouts but may shift certain fields.)

08670000000000e0ff0ffff77f23287a0000000000000000000000000000005f0e007907000000000001ce7b52010500beffb501ee0ffeff04000200000000


### üì¶ Field Breakdown (based on known Joy-Con 2 layout)
huge thanks to [@german77](https://github.com/german77) for providing me with the notification layout below!!

### üß† Technical Notes

- **Left Joy-Con** does not have a right stick, so data at offset `0x0B‚Äì0x0D` is **not meaningful**. For completeness, it‚Äôs still included in the layout but should be ignored in parsing logic.
- **Battery voltage** (`0x1F`) appears to be zero in this packet. Normally, this reports in millivolts (e.g., `3000 = 3.0V`), but `0x0000` likely means the value is not available at the time of sampling.
- **Stick values** are 12-bit X/Y pairs packed across 3 bytes:
  - X: upper 12 bits of first 1.5 bytes
  - Y: lower 12 bits of next 1.5 bytes
- **IMU data** (Accel + Gyro) uses 16-bit signed integers:
  - Accelerometer: `4096 = 1G`
  - Gyroscope: `48000 = 360¬∞/s`
- **Temperature** is calculated with:  
  `25¬∞C + (raw / 127)` ‚Üí `25 + (3679 / 127) ‚âà 54¬∞C`
